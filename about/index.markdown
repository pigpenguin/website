About me
--------
My name is Ethan Rooke however on the internet I tend to go by pigpenguin. So yeah this is my website, I will probably be uupdating it with actual things soon, problem being I have not finished anything worth blogging about at the moment so I guess when I do I will put it up. In theory it will be either code or robotics related seeing as those are what I primarily work on for fun.
About the site
